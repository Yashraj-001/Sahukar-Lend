# Sahukar-Lend

**Sahukar-Lend** is a decentralized lending protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to borrow, lend, and manage loans securely using smart contracts. This project includes both a command-line interface for testing and a Solidity smart contract for blockchain functionality.

## Introduction

Sahukar-Lend aims to revolutionize the traditional lending ecosystem by providing a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform for asset borrowing and lending. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Sahukar-Lend eliminates intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and ensures trustless interactions between parties.

## Features

- Borrow and lend assets securely
- Manage loan repayment
- Collateral-based lending system
- CLI interface for quick testing and interactions
- Smart contracts for decentralized operations

## Uniqueness

- Built on the high-speed and low-cost Solana blockchain
- Simple and intuitive CLI interface for developers
- Comprehensive test scenarios to simulate real-world use cases
- Fully decentralized, ensuring security and transparency

## Future Scope

- Integration with other blockchain networks for interoperability
- Development of a fully functional web-based interface
- Expansion to include more asset types for lending and borrowing
- Implementation of advanced loan management features like dynamic interest rates
- Partnering with DeFi protocols to enhance liquidity and lending options

   ```

3. **Run the CLI application:**
   Use the following command to run the `lender.js` script:
   ```bash
   node lender.js
   ```

4. **Deploy the Solidity Smart Contract:**
   Compile and deploy the `lender.sol` contract using your preferred Solidity development environment, such as Remix or Hardhat.

## Usage

### Run in CLI
To interact with the application through the command line:
```bash
node lender.js
```

### Solidity Smart Contract
To deploy the smart contract:
